# Overview of Project
This project allows users to filter data with multiple criteria. The first deliverable there was only one filter: date. With this update, we are adding four more filters: city, state, country, and shape.

# Results
This webpage is user friendly, it allows the user to filter data by city, state, date, etc. So when the user wants to do a search they want to apply the filters, in order to do that do the following:
  1. Go to the "Filter Search"

  2. The user will see 5 boxes: date, city, state, country, shape. So the user only have to capture the data he/she wants to display and then the results will be filtered.

The filters are pretty useful because it resumes all the information into the search criteria.

# Summary
One drawback I noticed is that there should be like a "help" section on how to input the criteria search. For instance: in the State section the user would want to know if he/she have to write the complete state name or only the two first letters.

Also it would be great to have the location of the event and add some images to support the result.
